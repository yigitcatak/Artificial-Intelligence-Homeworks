We can think the object as 2 cubes merged and the 4 coordinates are x1, y1, x2 and y2 with x1,y1 and x2,y2 indicating the coordinates of two cubes over the board matrix ignoring the z-plane when object is vertical and showing it with another label to tell which of the x-y-z plane object lies across.\n","\n","> For example the given object to us in the sample case of the homework document according to this state aproach is stated as **(2, 3, 3, 3, \"y\")** indicating the object is lying on the y-plane and its cubes are on the tiles (2,3) and (3,3). Similarly in the sample case the goal state is **(4, 7, 4, 7, \"z\")** indicating the object is vertiacl (lying on the z-plane) and its both cubes are on the tile (4,7).\n","\n","Generally there are 4 successor states indicating the movements in 4 directions over x-y plane with up, down, left and right. However each move function has 3 different scenerios depending on which plane object lies along (Check the movement functions in the class definition for further information). And there are some movement restrictions such that object can't move if after movement at least one of its cubes will be out of the Board etc..\n","\n","Initial state **(as an example is given above)** is just which tiles the object starts lying on which plane. And it can be easily extracted by reading the board matrix if there is a single S at a position x1,y1 then the initial state is (x1,y1,x1,y1) -object is at vertical at position (x1,y1)- and if there are two S at positions (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) the initial state is (x1,y1,x2,y2) -object is horizontal at position (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)-. Note that either x1 should be equal to x2 or y1 should be equal to y2 since the object cannot stand diagonally.\n","\n","Assuming goal states are always 1 block wide -object need to stand on goal vertically-, goal test can be easily done by two steps. First define goal coordinate as a state **(as an example is given above)**, if goal is at position (xg,yg) then goal state is (xg,yg,xg,yg,\"z\"). Then as a second step we can easily check if the state we reached is goal state or not.\n","\n","Finally as the game works with move count normally, we can accept each move as equal cost. Ultimately, converging UCS to BFS. **But a stepcost is set in the A* Search part according to the situation, please check there.**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5ITyyTMFPVpQ"},"source":["**Defining node as a class, including state, successor state generating functions and other functions:**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Gu_IH9HOPUsm"},"source":["class Node:\n","  def __init__ (self,x1,y1,x2,y2,status,previous=None):\n","    self.x1 = x1\n","    self.y1 = y1\n","    self.x2 = x2\n","    self.y2 = y2\n","    self.status = status # \"z\" = lies on z plane, \"x\" = lies on x plane \n","    #\"y\" = lies on y plane\n","    self.previous = previous\n","\n","##### SHOW STATUS -

indicate that since the runing time of the algorithms, as it should be expected, changes each time they are run by a very little ammount (around 3ms); while this ammount is insignificantly small, since the runtimes of the algorithms are also very short (even shorter in smaller cases) this sometimes messes with the comparison of times however there are some significant results.\n","\n","Second, A* algorithm with tile tracking has more condition checks than all other algorithms here. Therefore it is time-wise left behind other algorithms  when statespace is smaller, where brute force of no tile tracking beats the smartness of tile tracking with no time wasted in condition checks.\n","\n","And lastly all algorithms are evaluated with the UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT expansion order.\n","\n","**Conclusion**\n","\n","AS it can be expected, A* Search has always given better results when comparing the space consumed to store the explored nodes compared to UCS. Also notice that, as the depth increased (move count, depth of goal in the search space), the gap between the performance of A* search and UCS algorithms became unignorably huge. \n","\n","In the tracking versions of algorithms, as the number of nodes to be explored reduced runing time of the A* search was no faster than UCS algorithm (as explained above, also see in the table for Board1, 2 and 3); however as the space size increased (there wasn't a significant increase in our test cases but it can be still seen in Board4), the runing time of the A* search started improving against UCS.\n","\n","In non-tracking versions, the results are even more devastating for the sake of UCS algorithm. A* Search dramatically reduces the space used for the problem; infact as the depth increases, the space used by non-tracking A* search decreases exponentially compared to the non-tracking UCS. Additionally as condition checks are not included, A* search is not slowed down, the running time of the A* search was better than UCS even in the smaller depths/search spaces.\n","\n","Without a doubt, tracking version of the both algorithms can always be considered better than their non-tracking counterparts both by an expection before the testing and by the results of the testing. Finally, tracking A* search algorithm can be accepted as the best out of these four algorithms for this problem. Even if it was slower in than some other algorithms in some of the cases, the time difference was always negligible; Additionally it always gave the least space occupation across all of the four algorithms in all cases."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"y-RoC63dEn79","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1605018899315,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":6099,"user":{"displayName":"Yiğit Çatak","photoUrl":"","userId":"16850806305811871413"}},"outputId":"f494fade-5933-4846-f2a6-30072e404a45"},"source":["\"\"\"%%capture\n","!wget -nc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brpy/colab-pdf/master/colab_pdf.py\n","from colab_pdf import colab_pdf\n","colab_pdf('HW1_yigit_catak.ipynb')\"\"\""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["\"%%capture\\n!wget -nc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brpy/colab-pdf/master/colab_pdf.py\\nfrom colab_pdf import colab_pdf\\ncolab_pdf('HW1_yigit_catak.ipynb')\""]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":32}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"hfv8wWh-mptn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1609112963885,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":1578,"user":{"displayName":"Yiğit Çatak","photoUrl":"","userId":"16850806305811871413"}},"outputId":"7cb73acd-d617-4022-99d3-cea9fb2b1603"},"source":["targetBoard = \"/content/drive/My Drive/CS 404/HW1/\" + \"Board1.txt\"\n","File = open(targetBoard, 'r')\n","\n","Lines = File.readlines()\n","\n","type(Lines[2])"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["str"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":2}]}]}
